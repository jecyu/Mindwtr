## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State**: Zustand (shared with mobile)
- **Platform**: Tauri v2 (Rust backend, WebKitGTK)
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit

### Why Tauri?

- 🚀 **Small binary** (~5MB vs ~150MB for Electron)
- 💾 **Low memory** (~50MB vs ~300MB for Electron)
- 🦀 **Rust backend** for fast file operations
- 🖥️ **Native dialogs** via system webview

### Security Note

- Tauri (`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`) and static PWA builds (`public/_headers`) ship a restrictive CSP. Avoid loading untrusted remote content in the webview.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (for building Tauri)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (package manager)

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S rust webkit2gtk-4.1 base-devel
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# From monorepo root
bun install

# Run desktop app (dev mode)
cd apps/desktop
bun dev

# Or from root
bun desktop:dev
```

## Building

```bash
# Build for distribution
bun run build

# Output in src-tauri/target/release/
```

### macOS: build with `build:local`, not `build`

A plain `bun run build` / `bunx tauri build` on macOS fails twice. Both are local-configuration
gaps, not source problems — CI sets the same values (`.github/workflows/release-macos.yml:411`).

```bash
# From the repo root — sets the three variables below for you
bun run desktop:build:local
```

The equivalent by hand:

```bash
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15
export CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15
export APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="-"   # ad-hoc; omit if you have a Developer ID cert
bun run desktop:build
```

`build:local` exists as a separate script on purpose: it must not be folded into `build`, because
CI passes the real `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` secret and a hardcoded `-` there would silently
override it and ship ad-hoc-signed release builds.

| Without it | Failure |
| --- | --- |
| `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` / `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` | The deployment target falls back to 10.13, but whisper.cpp's `ggml` uses `std::filesystem` (needs 10.15): `error: 'path' is unavailable: introduced in macOS 10.15` |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | `tauri.conf.json` pins `"signingIdentity": "Developer ID Application"`; without that certificate the bundle step dies at `Developer ID Application: no identity found` |

### The build succeeds but the app won't launch

`build:local` also overrides `bundle.macOS.entitlements` to `Entitlements.local.plist` (an empty
set). This is not optional — without it the build completes and the app is **killed at launch**
with no crash report:

```
$ /Applications/Mindwtr.app/Contents/MacOS/mindwtr
$ echo $?
137                      # SIGKILL
$ spctl -a -vvv -t exec /Applications/Mindwtr.app
/Applications/Mindwtr.app: rejected
```

`Entitlements.mac.plist` — the file CI uses — declares restricted capabilities (team identifier,
iCloud/CloudKit containers, `aps-environment`, an application group). Those are only valid under a
real Developer ID with a matching provisioning profile. Ad-hoc signed, the kernel refuses to
authorize them and terminates the process.

The empty set is correct for a local build: it is not sandboxed, so the App Sandbox entitlements
in the CI file are inert, and the features they gate (microphone, calendars) are governed at
runtime by TCC plus the usage-description strings in `Info.plist`.

`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="-"` produces an ad-hoc signature. The app runs, but Gatekeeper will
block the first launch — right-click → Open, or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Mindwtr.app`.

The `bundle_dmg.sh` step can fail in a plain terminal (it drives Finder via AppleScript to lay out
the DMG window). That is not fatal: `target/release/bundle/macos/Mindwtr.app` is complete and
installable on its own.

Windows release builds also publish `mindwtr_<version>_windows_x64_portable.zip`.
Extract it to a writable folder and keep `portable.txt` next to `mindwtr.exe`.

## Data Storage

Tasks are saved to:

- **Linux data**: `~/.local/share/mindwtr/mindwtr.db` (the working database), plus `~/.local/share/mindwtr/data.json` (the sync and backup snapshot)
- **Linux config**: `~/.config/mindwtr/config.toml`

Desktop Settings → Sync → Local Data shows the exact paths for your OS. If you used very early builds, data may exist under legacy Tauri directories like `~/.config/tech.dongdongbh.mindwtr/` and `~/.local/share/tech.dongdongbh.mindwtr/` and will be migrated automatically.

Portable Windows builds store local state beside the executable:

- **Portable data**: `profile/data/mindwtr.db`, `profile/data/data.json`, logs, snapshots, and audio captures
- **Portable config**: `profile/config/config.toml` and `profile/config/secrets.toml`

Portable mode stores secrets in the local `profile/config/secrets.toml` file instead of the OS keychain/keyring. Windows WebView2 is still required.

## Sync

Configure sync in Settings:

- **File Sync** - iCloud Drive, Dropbox folders, Google Drive, Syncthing, network shares, etc.
- **WebDAV** - Nextcloud, ownCloud, self-hosted servers
- **Dropbox** - Direct Dropbox App Folder sync in supported builds
- **Cloud** - Self-hosted cloud backend (see https://docs.mindwtr.app/data-sync/ and https://docs.mindwtr.app/data-sync/cloud-deployment)
- **External Calendars (ICS)** - View-only calendar overlay

Sync recommendation:

- Prefer **WebDAV** for frequent multi-device edits.
- If using **Syncthing**, use `Send & Receive` + `Watch for Changes`, keep scan intervals short, and tap **Sync now** before switching devices.

## Testing

```bash
bun run test
```

Includes unit tests, component tests, and accessibility tests.
